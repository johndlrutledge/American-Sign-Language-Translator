# American-Sign-Language-Translator-
The purpose of this project is to create an app or web feature that can use a camera to focus on an individual who is communicating through American sign language. While there are many applications—such as Google translate—that allow realtime translation of spoken and written language, this app will do this with hand gestures. The program will be able to recognize the hand gestures of someone signing in real time and translate them into English words or letters. There are multiple outcomes for the project, including potentially being a learning resource for those who would like to learn American Sign Language (ASL), or using it as a way to easily communicate with someone who is hearing impaired and prefers to use sign language.
